# Wooram Son (손우람)

I'm a first year PhD student in the XR Lab at Konkuk University. I'm advised by [Youngwoon Cha](https://sites.google.com/site/youngwooncha/).

Previously, I was an radiation applied life science major at Seoul National University, where I received my MS. I also hold a BS in computer science and engineering from Konkuk University. I worked as a Software Engineer at Samsung Electronics and served as a Research Scientist in Clinical Research Institute at Seoul National University Hospital.
