# SpacingRNN

This project implements a SpacingRNN model for Korean word spacing using PyTorch.

## Introduction

The SpacingRNN model aims to automatically insert spaces between Korean words in a sentence. This task is crucial for natural language processing applications such as text segmentation, parsing, and machine translation. The model utilizes a bidirectional LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network architecture to predict the optimal spacing between characters.

## Required Packages
